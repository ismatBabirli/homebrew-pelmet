# Canonical source for the Pelmet Homebrew cask.
#
# This file is the source of truth. `scripts/bootstrap-tap.sh` seeds it into the
# ismatBabirli/homebrew-pelmet tap, and the release workflow keeps the tap copy's
# `version` + `sha256` in sync on every tagged release.
#
# The sha256 below is a placeholder until the first release is cut; the release
# workflow overwrites it with the real DMG checksum.
